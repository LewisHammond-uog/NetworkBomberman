# CT5052_Network_Programming

This is the framework that is to be utilised for the assessment task for the UoG module CT5052 Network Programming. This repository contains a lightweight rendering framework that implements OpenGL through GLFW, GLAD, and uses GLM as it's maths library.

The framework has functionality to draw simple primitives, lines and some other geometric shapes. There is a simple camera that is able to be navigated around the rendered scene with the mouse and WASD keys.

The student is to use this base framework to implement RakNet as a netowrking library to create an example of a game that demonstrates network gameplay.
